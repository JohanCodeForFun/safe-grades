      <p>
        Safe Grades was founded with the mission to provide educators with a secure and efficient platform for managing student submissions. 
        In an era where online learning is becoming the norm, we recognized the need for a solution that not only simplifies the grading process 
        but also ensures the safety and integrity of student work. Our team is dedicated to creating tools that empower educators, 
        allowing them to focus on what they do best: teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that every educator deserves a reliable system that supports their grading needs while maintaining the highest standards of security. 
        Join us on our journey to transform the educational landscape, one assignment at a time.
